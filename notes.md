This is a note of Xinjie Ge for learning bitcoin book.

## Chapter 01 introduction

bitcoin protocol: Bitcoin protocol stack, it is a set of protocols and technology stacks in the Bitcoin network used to achieve functions such as transaction processing, blockchain synchronization, and node communication. This protocol stack includes multiple levels of protocols and components, such as the network layer, transport layer, consensus algorithm, etc., which work together to ensure the normal operation and security of the entire Bitcoin system.

Users of Bitcoin control keys that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the Bitcoin network. With these keys, they can sign transactions to unlock the value and spend it by transferring it to a new owner.

The difficulty of the computational task that miners must perform is adjusted dynamically so that, on average, someone **succeeds every 10 minutes** regardless of how many miners (and how much processing) are competing at any moment.

Due to Bitcoinâ€™s diminishing rate of issuance (half of the remaining bitcoins are added to the circulation every 4 years), over the long term, the Bitcoin currency is deflationary.
